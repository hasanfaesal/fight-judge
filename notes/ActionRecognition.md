Given keypoint-skeletons in multiple frames, what might be the best way to perform action recognition?

The nature of the data is spatio-temporal, so in theory the following models can work:
- RNNs (LSTM/GRU)
- TCNs (Temporal Convolutional Networks)
- Transformers
- Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
